# Python Project Template

This repository serves as a simple template for a Python project, providing a basic file structure for organizing your code and data, as well as a starting point for common dependencies and licensing. The repository includes the following folders:

- `data/`: For storing any data files used in your project.
- `tests/`: For unit tests to ensure the functionality of your code.
- `src/`: For all source code files.
- `requirements.txt`: A list of dependencies required for your project.
- `pyproject.toml`: A beginning to a CI/CD pipeline.

## Getting Started

1. Click the "Use this template" button or clone the repository to start your new project.
2. Install dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Add your own code to the `src/` directory.
4. Add any data files to the `data/` directory.
5. Write unit tests for your code in the `tests/` directory.
6. Run tests with `python -m unittest discover tests/`.
7. Once you're ready to share your project, modify the `LICENSE` file to reflect your desired licensing terms.

## Dependencies

The `requirements.txt` file lists common dependencies for many Python projects, but you can modify this file to include any additional dependencies required by your project.

## License

This repository is licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE), which allows for both personal and commercial use. Feel free to modify this file to reflect the licensing terms for your own project.


## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Note: I would also recommend creating a virtual environment to go along with this project, but it is currently ignored according to the .gitignore.
